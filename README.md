This project is a challenge from Frontend Mentor (see frontend-mentor.md).

It is a multi-page website built with React and set up with Parcel.
The styles are SCSS partials called from main.scss.
The team members are in a JS object in a separate file. The AboutPage.js component loops through the array of objects and calls the TeamMembers.js component for the card element.
This component handles the state for the card being flipped or not and displays the appropriate content. 

An extra component called ScrollToTop.js was added from the React documentation to bring the user back to the top of the page once they clicked a link.
