# MyTeam Multi-page website - Frontend Mentor

This project is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## About 

It is a multi-page website built with React and bundled with Parcel.
The styles were organized and made using SCSS.<br>
Team members data is in a JS object in a separate file. <br>
The `AboutPage.js` component loops through the array of objects and calls the `TeamMembers.js` component for the card element.
This component handles the state for the card being flipped or not and displays the appropriate content. <br>

An extra component called `ScrollToTop.js` was added from the React documentation to bring the user back to the top of the page once they clicked a link.
